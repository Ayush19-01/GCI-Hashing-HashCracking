# GCI-Hashing-HashCracking
### What does the program do?

The program is designed to encrypt your messages. The user get's 6 options to choose from:
  
  1.MD5 :The MD5 function is a cryptographic algorithm that takes an input of arbitrary length and produces a message digest that 
  is 128 bits long.
  
  2.SHA1 : SHA-256 Cryptographic Hash Algorithm. A cryptographic hash (sometimes called 'digest') is a kind of 'signature' for a 
  text or a data file. SHA-256 generates an almost-unique 256-bit (32-byte) signature for a text.
